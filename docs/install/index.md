## Post-Install Notes
Upon installing, GLang requires ~5 MB of space. As far as computer power goes, that's up to you! It's optimized to run well even on low-end laptops.

## After-Install Notes
Once GLang is installed, you can use `glang self <option>` to manage the GLang binary and components.

Updating to the latest version:

```sh
glang self update
```

Uninstalling all components and external files:

```sh
glang self uninstall
```
