# üåê The George Language Website

This repository houses the **official website**, **documentation**, and **guidebook** for the [George Programming Language (GLang)](https://github.com/george-language/glang).

Whether you‚Äôre fixing a typo, expanding the docs, or redesigning the site, every contribution helps make GLang stronger.

## Project Overview

This site is built using **[VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/)**, a fast, modern static site generator powered by Vite.

The goal is to make GLang‚Äôs documentation easy to navigate, maintain, and update.

**Contents:**

- `/docs/` ‚Üí all documentation pages
- `/book/` ‚Üí all book pages
- `/about/` ‚Üí about page
- `/public/` ‚Üí static assets (images, icons, etc.)
- `.vitepress/` ‚Üí site configuration and theme settings

## Requirements

Before contributing, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node)

You can check your versions with:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
