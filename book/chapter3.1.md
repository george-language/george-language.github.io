# Chapter 3.1: If, Also If, and Otherwise

## Conditions

It is very common that programmers use conditions in their code. Conditions are a way to execute some amount of code if something meets a certain criteria. The `if` statement is a great example of that.

```
obj x = 10;

if x == 10 { # '==' is a operator to check if something equals another value
    bark("x is 10!"); # since x is 10, this code will always be ran inside the 'if' block.
}
```
