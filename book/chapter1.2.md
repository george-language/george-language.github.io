# Chapter 1.2: Install & Setup

GLang is available for macOS and Windows. You can install it from [here](/docs/install/) and instructions are available [here](/docs/install/#install-instructions).

We also suggest using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write code. An IDE is your companion for development, like a super advanced version of Google Docs. Some beginners prefer a plain text editor, but we recommend using an IDE with a terminal and text editor. Both VSCode and Zed are great options.
