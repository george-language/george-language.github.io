# Chapter 8.2: Customizing Output

Your banking system _works_, but let‚Äôs be real... it‚Äôs a bit plain.

If you want to make your program more **user-friendly** (and easier to read), adding some color and style to your terminal output can make a huge difference.

## Step 1: Meet Kennels

GLang doesn‚Äôt include built-in styling tools by default. That‚Äôs where **kennels** come in, pre-made code packages you can download and use in your projects.

_You can learn more about kennels [here](/docs/kennels/)._

For this chapter, we‚Äôll use a kennel called `fancy-terminal`, it gives you easy-to-use color and text style controls through string expressions!

## Step 2: Installing and Using `fancy-terminal`

First, make sure you‚Äôve installed the kennel:

```sh
glang install fancy-terminal
```

Then import it into your program:

```glang
fetch fancy_terminal; # enables color and style support

bark(GREEN + "All systems ok." + RESET);
bark(RED + "A critical error occurred!" + RESET);
```

**How it works:**
Each color (like `RED` or `GREEN`) is just a special string variable that tells your terminal to display text in that color until it hits a `RESET`. You can also mix and match styles like `BOLD`, `ITALIC`, or `UNDERLINE` to make your output *pop*.

For a full list of supported colors and styles, check out the [official docs](https://github.com/george-language/fancy-terminal?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-styles).

## Step 3: Applying Styles to Your Banking System

Now that you‚Äôve got `fancy-terminal` installed, you can make your bank‚Äôs messages easier to read (and way cooler).

For example, in **`system.glang`**, you can highlight error messages in red:

```glang
# system.glang
# ...

bark(RED + format("Error: account '{}' not found", name) + RESET);
```

You can even go wild with color-coded output:

- Green for success ‚úÖ
- Red for errors ‚ùå
- Yellow for warnings ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Blue for informational messages ‚ÑπÔ∏è

## What's Next

Keep coding! Developers are always needed everywhere, no matter what. You can write other programs in GLang, or move on to bigger languages like Python or JavaScript. When it comes to software, the world is your oyster.
