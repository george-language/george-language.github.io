# Chapter 1.1: What Is GLang?

GLang is a **dynamically-typed**, **interpreted**, **high-level** programming language. This means when you create a variable, object, or item in the language, you don't have to give it a type (GLang does this for you!)

::: info
Types are ways to represent real-world objects in programming, for example, text is commonly known as a "string", or a number may be known as an "integer" or "float".
:::

When a language is interpreted, it essentially means the language is run through **line-by-line** to build an output. For example, if we create some line of code in an interpreted language, the code is never read until we actually tell the language to go to that code. You can think of an interpreter as a magnifying glass that studies your program as you run it.

_Examples of interpreted languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby_

GLang is focused on being as close as possible to human language without the complexity of memory management. Most programming languages (e.g. C or C++) leave the programmer up to controlling the computer's memory. We commonly refer to these languages as "low level", because they talk directly to your computer's hardware. GLang is instead a **high-level** language, it manages all the memory and allocation for you!
