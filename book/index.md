# GLang Guidebook

## About
This book serves as a way to learn GLang through actual use. We start from scratch and learn how GLang works, then in the final chapter, we build a personalized terminal command!

## How to use this book
In general, this book assumes that youâ€™re reading it in sequence from front to back. Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier chapters might not delve into details on a particular topic but will revisit the topic in a later chapter.

All chapters in this book are considered "learning chapters", but some chapters may include small challenges at the end to apply the knowledge you have learned.
